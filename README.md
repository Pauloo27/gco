## Hooks

You can add Pre and Post commit hooks in `.gcorc.json`, like that:
```json
...

  "PreCommit": [
    {
      "Command": "make",
      "ExitOnFail": true,
      "Ask": false
    }
  ],
  "PostCommit": [
    {
      "Command": "git push",
      "ExitOnFail": true,
      "Ask": true
    }
  ]
  
...
```

A hook is made of:
- Command: the command to run.
- ExitOnFail: if the command fail, should the commit be cancelled?
- Ask: ask for confirmation before running the hook.

_GCO hooks does not replace Git hooks._
