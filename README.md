## Install

If you have Go installed, you can simply do:
`go install github.com/Pauloo27/gco/cmd/gco@latest`



## Config

You can create a config per repository, it should be placed at the root of
the git repository with the name `.gco.json` (create it by running `gco -init`).

You also can have a global config at `~/.config/gco.json` 
(create it by running `gco -init-global`). The global config is used when 
there's no config at the repository level.

## Prefix pack

You can either use text prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `ci:`) or emojis 
(`‚ú®`, `üêõ`, `üë∑`). You will be prompt to select one when you run `gco --init`.

## Hooks

You can add Pre and Post commit hooks in `.gco.json`, like that:
```json
...

  "PreCommit": [
    {
      "Command": "make",
      "ExitOnFail": true,
      "Ask": false
    }
  ],
  "PostCommit": [
    {
      "Command": "git push",
      "ExitOnFail": true,
      "Ask": true
    }
  ]
  
...
```

A hook is made of:
- Command: the command to run.
- ExitOnFail: if the command fail, should the commit be cancelled?
- Ask: ask for confirmation before running the hook.

_GCO hooks does not replace Git hooks._
